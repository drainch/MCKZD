## WHAT IS MCKZD?

MCKZD is an AI-powered cross-platform music system that connects your Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, and Tidal accounts to analyze your full listening history.

It doesn’t guess your vibe — it knows what you’ve already loved.  
Then it builds with you.

## CORE FEATURES

- **Connected Accounts Hub**  
  Link your streaming platforms in one place. MCKZD pulls your full listening history across services.

- **Prompt-Based Playlist Generator**  
  Type in a feeling, mood, or intention — and MCKZD creates emotionally intelligent playlists based on your actual music habits and platform histories.

- **Playlist Reconstructor**  
  Rebuild playlists using your listening data across accounts.  
  Example: “Recreate this YouTube playlist using my Apple Music + Spotify history.”

- **Cross-Platform Music Identity**  
  Your music tastes aren’t limited to one app — MCKZD keeps your entire sonic fingerprint unified and alive.
